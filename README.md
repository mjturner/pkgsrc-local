# pkgsrc-local

Repository containing a set of my own local [pkgsrc](1) packages. To use them,
clone them into a subdirectory of `${PKGSRCDIR}`, eg, `local`. Assuming
`${PKGSRCDIR}` is set to the location of your pkgsrc tree:

    cd ${PKGSRCDIR}
    git clone https://github.com/mjturner/pkgsrc-local local

This is very much a "work-in-progress" repository, primarily for my own use.
Once packages are ready for a wider audience they'll be committed to
[pkgsrc-wip](2) and then typically removed from here.
