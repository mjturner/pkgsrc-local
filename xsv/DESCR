TODO: Adjust the following lines from README.md

xsv is a command line program for indexing, slicing, analyzing, splitting
and joining CSV files. Commands should be simple, fast and composable:

1. Simple tasks should be easy.
2. Performance trade offs should be exposed in the CLI interface.
3. Composition should not come at the expense of performance.

This README contains information on how to
[install `xsv`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/xsv#installation), in addition to
a quick tour of several commands.
