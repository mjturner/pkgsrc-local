fd is a simple, fast and user-friendly alternative to find.

While it does not seek to mirror all of *find*'s powerful functionality, it
provides sensible (opinionated) defaults for 80% of the use cases.

Features
* Convenient syntax: "fd PATTERN" instead of "find -iname '*PATTERN*'".
* Colorized terminal output (similar to ls).
* It's *fast*
* Smart case: the search is case-insensitive by default. It switches to
  case-sensitive if the pattern contains an uppercase character.
